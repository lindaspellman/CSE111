Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
    Count Specific Word in a Text Document

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    I am a creative writer. At times it is useful to know how many times I use a certain word, 
    so that I can change it to a more unique word. This program will read a text file and count 
    how often each word occurs in the file.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    I think I will learn about picking out certain words from a text document and counting the number of its
    occurences.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
    I'm not sure yet.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
    I think that would be the most sensible idea.

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
    I will.
